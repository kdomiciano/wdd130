    <h2>Karina Domiciano</h2>
    <h2>Hello everyone!</h2>
    <p>My name is Karina Domiciano and I'm studying Software Development through BYU-Idaho online.
    <br> I'm 31 years old and I live with my husband in Portugal. We have 2 cats named Yuki and Aslan and a dog named Bucky. <br>
    <br>I've always been passionate about IT but life took me down another path and last year I graduated from my bachelor's in Biochemistry.
    <br>I'm very grateful for that experience but I wish to build a career in something I truly love doing, hence me being here.
    <br> I'm not yet sure which area I'll pursue since I don't have a practical knowledge in any of them, but conceptually I'm 
    <br>interested in Web - Development, Game Development and AI.</p>
    <p>I felt prompted to enroll on the BYU-Pathway program and I'm really grateful for this gospel-centered learning experience.</p>
